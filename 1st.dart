 //Write a program that calculates the area and perimeter of a rectangle given its length and width. Use the appropriate arithmetic operators.
 
void main(List<String> args) {
  // calculates the area of a rectangle??

  int length = 40;
  int width = 40;
  int area = length * width;
  print("the area of a rectangle is $area");
  // calculates the perimeter of a rectangle??

  int parimeter = 2 * (length + width);
  print("the area of a rectangle is $parimeter");
}
